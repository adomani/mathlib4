# Discrete Valuations

A valuation `v : A → ℤₘ₀` on a ring `A` is said to be a (normalized) discrete valuation if
`ofAdd (-1 : ℤ)` belongs to the image of `v`. Note that valuations in Mathlib are multiplicative;
if `a : A → ℤ ∪ {infty}` is the additive valuation associated to `v`, this is equivalent to asking
that `1 : ℤ` belongs to the image of `a`.

## Main Definitions
* `IsDiscrete`: We define a valuation to be discrete if it is `ℤₘ₀`-valued and `ofAdd (-1 : ℤ)`
  belongs to the image.

## TODO
* Define (pre)uniformizers for nontrivial `ℤₘ₀`-valued valuations.
* Relate discrete valuations and discrete valuation rings.
